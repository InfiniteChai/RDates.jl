# Primitives

RDates is designed to allow complex date operations to be completed using basic primitive types. Each of these primitive types and operations are explained in more detail in subsequent sections.

We now go through each of the primitive types, from which we can combine together using compounding operations. Also take note of the examples and the associated short-hand that we can use to define them
with the `rd""` macro.
